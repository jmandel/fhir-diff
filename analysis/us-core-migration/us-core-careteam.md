## Impact of R6 Changes on `us-core-careteam`

This section analyzes R6 changes to the base `CareTeam` resource that directly affect core elements, constraints, and patterns defined or mandated by `us-core-careteam`.

*   **`CareTeam.participant.member` (Must Support, Cardinality 1..1, specific `targetProfile`s)**
    *   **Relevant R6 Base Change:** The `CareTeam.participant.member` element in the R6 base `CareTeam` resource now permits `Reference(Group)` as a target type, in addition to the types allowed in R4. The R6 specification notes: "Using Group is only allowed when the group represents a family or a household and should not represent groups of Practitioners."
    *   **Direct Impact on `us-core-careteam`:** The `us-core-careteam` profile currently constrains `participant.member` to a specific list of `targetProfile`s (US Core Practitioner, Organization, Patient, PractitionerRole, CareTeam, RelatedPerson), which does *not* include `Group`. This means the current profile definition is more restrictive for `participant.member` types than the R6 base resource.
        The US Core editorial team will need to make a policy decision:
        1.  **Maintain current restriction (No `Group` references):** If `Group` should not be a valid member type for `us-core-careteam`, no change to the profile's `targetProfile` list for `participant.member` is strictly required. The existing profile definition already enforces this narrower list of types.
        2.  **Align with R6 base (Allow `Group` references):** If `Group` should be an allowed member type (respecting the R6 usage guidance), the profile would need to be updated. This would involve adding `Group` (or a specific US Core Group profile, if appropriate) to the `targetProfile` list for `CareTeam.participant.member`.

*   **Other Profiled Elements:**
    *   `CareTeam.status`: The `us-core-careteam` profile's `differential` correctly binds `CareTeam.status` to the canonical value set URL (`http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/care-team-status`). The R6 base resource also uses this canonical URL. Therefore, no change is needed for this element's binding due to R6 migration.
    *   `CareTeam.subject`: The profile's constraint (`min:1`, Must Support, `targetProfile` referencing `us-core-patient` or base `Group`) remains valid against the R6 base `CareTeam.subject` element.
    *   `CareTeam.participant.role`: The profile's constraint (`min:1`, `max:1`, Must Support) remains valid. The R6 base change of `CareTeam.participant.role` cardinality from `0..*` to `0..1` makes the base resource more aligned with the profile's stricter (single role) cardinality and does not adversely affect the profile.

*   **Elements Not Profiled by `us-core-careteam`:**
    Changes in the R6 base `CareTeam` resource to elements *not currently constrained* by `us-core-careteam` (e.g., `reasonCode`/`reasonReference` merging to `reason`, removal of `encounter`, `participant.period` changing to `effective[x]`, expansion of `onBehalfOf` types) do not directly break the existing `us-core-careteam` profile definition. These changes will, however, impact implementers who use these base resource features in conjunction with `us-core-careteam` instances.

## Migration Summary & Actionable Takeaways for `us-core-careteam`

1.  **US Core Profile Changes Required:**
    *   **Decision Point for `CareTeam.participant.member`:** The primary action is for the US Core team to decide whether to allow `Reference(Group)` for `CareTeam.participant.member`.
        *   If `Group` references are to be disallowed, no profile change is strictly necessary to maintain the current restriction.
        *   If `Group` references are to be allowed, the `targetProfile` list for `CareTeam.participant.member` in the `us-core-careteam` StructureDefinition must be updated.
    *   No other changes to the `us-core-careteam` profile are mandated by R6 base resource changes to maintain its current R4-based constraints.

2.  **Implementation Changes Required:**
    *   **For `CareTeam.participant.member`:**
        *   If US Core maintains the current restriction (no `Group` references), consuming applications do not need to change their handling of `participant.member` types for `us-core-careteam`.
        *   If US Core updates the profile to allow `Reference(Group)`, consuming applications will need to be updated to correctly process this additional reference type. Producing systems could then send `CareTeam.participant.member` as `Reference(Group)`.
    *   **For Unprofiled R6 Base Element Changes:** Implementers creating or consuming CareTeam resources (even if conforming to `us-core-careteam` for its specific constraints) need to be aware of and adapt to significant R6 changes in the base `CareTeam` resource if they use those features. These include:
        *   Data previously in `reasonCode` or `reasonReference` must now use the `reason` (CodeableReference) element.
        *   The `encounter` element is no longer available. Alternative association methods may be needed if this link was used.
        *   Data previously in `participant.period` must now use `participant.effective[x]` (choice of Period or Timing).
        *   The `participant.onBehalfOf` element can now reference a wider array of resource types.

3.  **New R6 Features Relevant to Profile Intent (Optional & Brief):**
    The US Core team could consider enhancing `us-core-careteam` in R6 by profiling new or changed R6 base `CareTeam` features, such as:
    *   **`CareTeam.reason`**: Profiling this `CodeableReference(Condition)` element could standardize how the reason for the care team is conveyed.
    *   **`CareTeam.participant.effective[x]`**: Profiling this element (choice of `Period` or `Timing`) could standardize how participant availability is expressed.

## Overall Migration Impact

Impact: Low

The migration from FHIR R4 to R6 has a **Low** direct impact on the `us-core-careteam` profile definition itself. The existing R4 constraints in `us-core-careteam` largely remain valid against the R6 base `CareTeam` resource.

The primary consideration for the US Core editorial team is a policy decision regarding `CareTeam.participant.member` and whether to allow `Reference(Group)` as a target type, aligning with an R6 base resource enhancement. If this change is adopted, it would be a minor update to the profile. Other R6 changes to the base `CareTeam` resource primarily affect elements not currently constrained by `us-core-careteam`; therefore, the profile itself does not "break" due to these base changes. Implementers using those unprofiled base features will face a larger migration effort for their systems, irrespective of the `us-core-careteam` profile.
