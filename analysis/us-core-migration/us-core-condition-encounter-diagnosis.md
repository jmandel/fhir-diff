## Impact of R6 Changes on `us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis`

The primary impact of migrating the base `Condition` resource from R4 to R6 on the `us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis` profile centers on the `Condition.clinicalStatus` element.

*   **`Condition.clinicalStatus`**
    *   **Profile Constraint in US Core R4:** This element is not explicitly constrained or made Must Support by `us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis` in R4; it inherits its `0..1` cardinality from the R4 base `Condition` resource.
    *   **Relevant R6 Base Change:** In R6, `Condition.clinicalStatus` becomes a mandatory element with a cardinality of `1..1`. The R4 constraint `con-5` (which stated `clinicalStatus` SHALL NOT be present if `verificationStatus` is 'entered-in-error') has also been removed in R6.
    *   **Direct Impact on `us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis`:**
        *   The `us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis` profile **must** be updated to reflect that `clinicalStatus` is now `1..1`.
        *   This element will also need to be designated as Must Support (`S`) in the profile, consistent with US Core policy for mandatory elements.
        *   Implementers will be required to always provide a `clinicalStatus` for any encounter diagnosis.
        *   Guidance will be needed for scenarios where `verificationStatus` is 'entered-in-error', as `clinicalStatus` will now be required, whereas previously it would have been absent. A value such as 'unknown' or another appropriate code from the `condition-clinical` value set will need to be supplied.

Other R6 changes to the base `Condition` resource (e.g., restructuring of `evidence`, addition of `bodyStructure`, changes to `asserter` targets, `stage.assessment` type change) do not directly affect the currently defined core elements, constraints, or patterns of the `us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis` profile, as these base elements are not constrained or made Must Support by this specific US Core profile. The change in the base binding strength for `Condition.category` from `extensible` to `preferred` has no material impact on this profile, as `us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis` already mandates a specific `patternCodeableConcept` for `category` (`encounter-diagnosis`).

## Migration Summary & Actionable Takeaways for `us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis`

*   **US Core Profile Changes Required:**
    *   Yes. The `us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis` profile definition must be updated:
        1.  Change `Condition.clinicalStatus` cardinality from the inherited `0..1` to `1..1`.
        2.  Set `Condition.clinicalStatus.mustSupport` to `true`.
        3.  Update profile documentation (e.g., "Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements" list) to reflect `clinicalStatus` as mandatory and Must Support.
        4.  Provide clear guidance on the implications of `clinicalStatus` being mandatory, particularly how it interacts with `verificationStatus` (especially 'entered-in-error') and what value to use if the status is not affirmatively known (e.g., 'unknown').

*   **Implementation Changes Required:**
    *   Yes.
        1.  **Data Producers:** Systems creating `us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis` resources **must** now always include the `clinicalStatus` element. This may require changes to ensure a value is always populated, potentially defaulting to 'unknown' or prompting for the information.
        2.  **Data Consumers:** Systems consuming these resources can now expect `clinicalStatus` to always be present. Validation logic should be updated accordingly.
        3.  Both producers and consumers need to understand that even if `verificationStatus` is 'entered-in-error', `clinicalStatus` must still be provided.

*   **New R6 Features Relevant to Profile Intent (Optional & Brief):**
    *   None of the new R6 features in the base `Condition` resource appear to offer immediate, compelling enhancements to the specific, narrow intent of the `us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis` profile as currently defined.

## Overall Migration Impact
Impact: Significant

The change of `Condition.clinicalStatus` from optional (`0..1`) in R4 to mandatory (`1..1`) in the R6 base `Condition` resource is a breaking change that directly impacts the `us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis` profile. The US Core editorial team will need to update the profile to reflect this new cardinality and Must Support status. More importantly, significant effort will be required to develop and communicate clear guidance to implementers on how to manage this newly mandatory element, especially in existing systems or data, and in conjunction with `verificationStatus` (e.g., when 'entered-in-error'). This requires careful decision-making and documentation updates.
