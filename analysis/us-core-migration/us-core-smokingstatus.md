## Impact of R6 Changes on `us-core-smokingstatus`

The `us-core-smokingstatus` profile is specific in its constraints. Most R6 changes to the base `Observation` resource do not force alterations to this profile's definition because its existing constraints are either more restrictive or remain compatible.

*   **`Observation.status`**:
    *   `us-core-smokingstatus` constrains `status` to `final | entered-in-error` via the value set `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-observation-smoking-status-status`.
    *   The R6 base `Observation.status` value set is significantly expanded (e.g., adding `corrected`, `cancelled`, `unknown`).
    *   **Impact on `us-core-smokingstatus`**: None. The profile's highly specific value set for `status` remains valid as `final` and `entered-in-error` are still permissible statuses in R6. The profile does not need to change its `status` constraint unless the US Core team decides to adopt new R6 status codes.

*   **`Observation.value[x]` (Allowed Types)**:
    *   `us-core-smokingstatus` constrains `value[x]` to either `valueQuantity` or `valueCodeableConcept` using slicing, and makes `value[x]` mandatory.
    *   The R6 base `Observation.value[x]` adds `Attachment` and `Reference(MolecularSequence)` as permitted data types.
    *   **Impact on `us-core-smokingstatus`**: None. The profile's existing constraints already limit `value[x]` to `Quantity` or `CodeableConcept`. These constraints remain valid. The profile does not automatically inherit the ability to use `Attachment` or `Reference(MolecularSequence)` for `value[x]`; adopting these would be a new design decision for US Core, not a requirement of R6 migration.

*   **`Observation.subject` and `Observation.performer` (Allowed Reference Targets)**:
    *   `us-core-smokingstatus` constrains `Observation.subject` to `Reference(us-core-patient)` and `Observation.performer` to a specific list of US Core profiles.
    *   The R6 base `Observation` expands the list of allowed target resource types for `subject` (e.g., `Organization`, `Procedure`) and `performer` (e.g., `HealthcareService`).
    *   **Impact on `us-core-smokingstatus`**: None. The profile's more restrictive `targetProfile` constraints remain valid in R6. No change to the profile definition is required for these elements.

In summary, the core structural definitions and constraints of `us-core-smokingstatus` (status, category, code, subject, effective[x], performer, value[x]) are not negatively impacted by R6 base `Observation` changes.

## Migration Summary & Actionable Takeaways for `us-core-smokingstatus`

*   **US Core Profile Changes Required**:
    *   The `fhirVersion` element in the `StructureDefinition` must be updated from `4.0.1` to the appropriate R6 version (e.g., `6.0.0`).
    *   No other structural changes to the profile's elements, cardinalities, value sets, or constraints are strictly required for R6 compatibility.

*   **Implementation Changes Required**:
    *   **Search Behavior for `value-string`**: This is the most significant impact for implementers. In R6, the `Observation.value-string` search parameter *only* searches `Observation.valueString`. In R4, it also searched `Observation.valueCodeableConcept.text`.
        *   Client applications searching `us-core-smokingstatus` instances and relying on `value-string` to match text within `Observation.valueCodeableConcept` (which is a common way to represent smoking status values) **must update their queries**. For R6, they may need to use `value-concept:text=[text]` or other appropriate search mechanisms.
        *   Server implementers must ensure their `value-string` search conforms to the stricter R6 definition.
    *   **General R6 Awareness**: Implementers whose systems handle generic R6 `Observation` resources (not just `us-core-smokingstatus`) will need to be prepared for the broader set of `Observation.status` codes and the new `value[x]` types (`Attachment`, `Reference(MolecularSequence)`). However, systems strictly consuming/producing only `us-core-smokingstatus` instances are shielded from these by the profile's specific constraints.

*   **New R6 Features Relevant to Profile Intent (Optional & Brief)**:
    *   **`Observation.instantiates[x]` (canonical(ObservationDefinition) | Reference(ObservationDefinition))**: US Core could consider leveraging this new R6 element in future `us-core-smokingstatus` versions. If standard `ObservationDefinition`s for smoking status assessments are developed, linking to them via `instantiates[x]` could improve consistency and semantic interoperability.

## Overall Migration Impact
Impact: **Low**

The `us-core-smokingstatus` profile itself requires minimal changes (primarily updating `fhirVersion`) to be R6 compliant. Its specific constraints on elements like `status` and `value[x]` mean it is not broken by R6 expansions in these areas. The primary actionable change falls on implementers due to the modification in the `value-string` search parameter behavior in the base `Observation` resource, which affects how data might be queried. No significant new decisions or community consensus are needed for the profile's definition itself.
