# FHIR Resource: Encounter

```yaml
resource:
  name: Encounter
  hl7_workgroup: Patient Administration
  maturity_level: 4
  standard_status: Trial Use
  security_category: Patient
  compartments:
    - Encounter
    - Group

```

An interaction between a patient and healthcare provider(s) for the purpose of providing healthcare service(s) or assessing the health status of a patient. Encounter is primarily used to record information about the actual activities that occurred, where Appointment is used to record planned activities.

## Background and Scope

The Encounter resource represents a wide range of interactions across different healthcare settings, including ambulatory (outpatient), inpatient, emergency, home health, and virtual encounters. It covers the lifecycle from pre-admission/planning through the actual interaction (or stay for inpatients) to discharge/completion.

Key aspects include:

*   **Broad Scope:** Not all elements are relevant in every setting. Admission/discharge details are grouped within an `admission` component.
*   **Classification:** The `class` element is crucial for distinguishing the encounter setting (e.g., inpatient, outpatient), guiding validation and business rules.
*   **Granularity:** The level of detail captured (e.g., a single encounter for a whole hospital stay vs. separate encounters for each practitioner visit) varies significantly based on organizational or jurisdictional practices. Encounters can be nested or grouped using the `partOf` element.
*   **Planning vs. Actual:** While `Appointment` handles scheduling, `Encounter` records the *actual* interaction. An `Encounter` can exist in a `planned` status before the event occurs, reflecting expected details like start times or locations.
*   **Status Management:**
    *   `status`: Tracks the overall state of the encounter workflow (e.g., `planned`, `in-progress`, `completed`).
    *   `subjectStatus`: Tracks the state of the *patient* within the encounter (e.g., `arrived`, `triaged`, `departed`). This binding is extensible for local workflow needs.
    *   `EncounterHistory` Resource: Used for tracking the detailed history of status changes, especially for long encounters, replacing the previous `statusHistory` and `classHistory` backbone elements from R4.
    *   "Admitted" Status: There's no single field indicating admission; it's inferred from context (e.g., `class`, `status` like `in-progress`, presence of the `admission` component).
    *   Leave/Hold: Statuses like `on-leave` (for the subject) and `on-hold` (for the encounter) can represent periods like weekend leave.
*   **Boundaries:**
    *   `Encounter` is for the actual event; `Appointment` is for planning/scheduling. An appointment is typically fulfilled and linked to a newly created encounter when the event starts.
    *   `Communication` is used for non-direct, often asynchronous interactions (like messages) without a recorded duration.
*   **Nesting Example:** A hospital stay (`Encounter` A) might contain moves between departments (`Encounter` B, C, D, each `partOf` A), and specific consultations during one part (`Encounter` E, F, G, each `partOf` C or A). Profiling is expected to constrain this flexibility for specific use cases.
*   **Associated Encounter Extension:** Use the standard `associatedEncounter` extension ([`http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/encounter-associatedEncounter`](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-extensions/StructureDefinition-encounter-associatedEncounter.html)) to link resources to an Encounter when no dedicated property exists.
