# FHIR Patient Resource: R4 to R6 Migration Diff Report

This report outlines the significant changes to the FHIR Patient resource from version R4 to R6. Implementers migrating existing systems or supporting both versions should pay close attention to these differences.

## High-Level Summary of Impactful Changes

The most significant changes for implementers revolve around:

1.  **`Patient.contact` Sub-elements:**
    *   The `relationship` element's binding has changed significantly, moving from a FHIR-specific ValueSet to the richer v3 `PersonalRelationshipRoleType`.
    *   A new `role` element has been introduced to distinguish functional roles from personal relationships.
    *   New `additionalName` and `additionalAddress` elements have been added to support multiple names and addresses for a contact, primarily for backward compatibility. These new elements are marked as "Trial Use."
2.  **`Patient.communication.language` Binding:** The primary binding for `language` has been strengthened to `required` against `all-languages` (BCP-47), with `common-languages` now offered as a "starter" set. This simplifies the primary expectation for language coding.
3.  **Scope and Guidance Refinements:** R6 provides more explicit guidance on differentiating Patient from `Person` and `RelatedPerson`, clarifies the non-use of `Linkage` for patient identity, and points to evolving standards like the Gender Harmony IG for sex and gender representation.
4.  **Trial Use Elements:** Several new elements within `Patient.contact` are marked "Trial Use" (`TU`), indicating they are available for testing but may change before becoming normative. Implementers should be cautious with production use.

Overall, the core structure of the Patient resource remains largely stable, with R6 introducing refinements, better terminological alignment, and more explicit guidance based on implementation experience.

## 1. Core Definition Changes

### `Patient.contact` Sub-elements

The `Patient.contact` backbone element has seen the most substantial modifications:

*   **`Patient.contact.relationship` (Binding Change)**
    *   **R4:**
        *   `binding.valueSet`: `http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/patient-contactrelationship`
        *   `binding.strength`: `extensible`
    *   **R6:**
        *   `binding.valueSet`: `http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-PersonalRelationshipRoleType`
        *   `binding.strength`: `preferred`
        *   `short`: Changed from "The kind of relationship" to "The kind of *personal* relationship".
        *   `comments`: "For personal relationships. Functional relationships use Patient.contact.role."
    *   **Rationale:** The v3 `PersonalRelationshipRoleType` ValueSet is a more comprehensive and widely recognized terminology for personal relationships. This change promotes better semantic interoperability.
    *   **Implications for Implementers:**
        *   Systems must update their mappings from the old R4 ValueSet to the new v3 ValueSet.
        *   Data transformation will be required for existing `Patient.contact.relationship` data.
        *   The distinction between "personal" and "functional" relationships is now explicit, requiring careful consideration during data entry and interpretation.

*   **`Patient.contact.role` (NEW Element - Trial Use)**
    *   **R4:** Not present.
    *   **R6:**
        *   `name`: `Patient.contact.role`
        *   `cardinality`: `0..*`
        *   `type`: `CodeableConcept`
        *   `binding.valueSet`: `http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/relatedperson-relationshiptype`
        *   `binding.strength`: `preferred`
        *   `flags`: `[TU]` (Trial Use)
        *   `short`: "The kind of functional role"
        *   `comments`: "For functional relationships. Personal relationships use Patient.contact.relationship."
    *   **Rationale:** Introduces a clear distinction between personal relationships (e.g., mother, spouse) and functional roles (e.g., emergency contact, power of attorney). This was previously ambiguous or required local extensions.
    *   **Implications for Implementers:**
        *   New element to support. If functional roles were previously overloaded into `relationship` or handled via extensions, data migration strategies are needed.
        *   Being "Trial Use," this element's definition might evolve. Implementers should monitor its status in future FHIR releases if adopting it.
        *   Applications will need to decide whether to populate `relationship`, `role`, or both, based on the nature of the contact.

*   **`Patient.contact.additionalName` (NEW Element - Trial Use)**
    *   **R4:** Not present.
    *   **R6:**
        *   `name`: `Patient.contact.additionalName`
        *   `cardinality`: `0..*`
        *   `type`: `HumanName`
        *   `flags`: `[TU]` (Trial Use)
        *   `short`: "Additional names for the contact person"
        *   `comments`: "Added for backward compatibility. Implementers should check both `name` and `additionalName` for a complete list."
    *   **Rationale:** Provides a standard way to record multiple names for a contact person, often needed for comprehensive representation and matching. The "backward compatibility" comment suggests it addresses a common need observed in previous implementations.
    *   **Implications for Implementers:**
        *   If systems need to store multiple names for a contact, this element can be used.
        *   Applications reading contact names should now check both `Patient.contact.name` and `Patient.contact.additionalName`.
        *   As a "Trial Use" element, its future is not fully guaranteed.

*   **`Patient.contact.additionalAddress` (NEW Element - Trial Use)**
    *   **R4:** Not present.
    *   **R6:**
        *   `name`: `Patient.contact.additionalAddress`
        *   `cardinality`: `0..*`
        *   `type`: `Address`
        *   `flags`: `[TU]` (Trial Use)
        *   `short`: "Additional addresses for the contact person"
        *   `comments`: "Added for backward compatibility. Implementers should check both `address` and `additionalAddress` for a complete list."
    *   **Rationale:** Similar to `additionalName`, this allows for multiple addresses for a contact person.
    *   **Implications for Implementers:**
        *   If systems need to store multiple addresses for a contact, this element can be used.
        *   Applications reading contact addresses should now check both `Patient.contact.address` and `Patient.contact.additionalAddress`.
        *   As a "Trial Use" element, its future is not fully guaranteed.

### `Patient.communication` Sub-elements

*   **`Patient.communication.language` (Binding Change)**
    *   **R4:**
        *   `binding.valueSet`: `http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/languages` (Common Languages)
        *   `binding.strength`: `preferred`
        *   `additional_binding`:
            *   `valueSet`: `http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/all-languages`
            *   `strength`: `required`
    *   **R6:**
        *   `binding.valueSet`: `http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/all-languages` (BCP-47 codes)
        *   `binding.strength`: `required`
        *   `additional_binding` (now described as "starter"):
            *   `valueSet`: `http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/languages` (Common languages)
            *   `purpose`: `starter`
    *   **Rationale:** This change simplifies the primary binding requirement to the comprehensive `all-languages` (BCP-47) ValueSet, which is the more robust standard. The `common-languages` ValueSet is still provided as a helpful "starter" set for convenience.
    *   **Implications for Implementers:**
        *   The primary validation for `Patient.communication.language` is now against the `all-languages` ValueSet.
        *   Systems should ensure they can store and process any valid BCP-47 language tag.
        *   While the `common-languages` set can still guide UI picklists, the system must accept any code from `all-languages`.

### Minor Clarifications & Refinements in Element Definitions

*   **`Patient.active`:**
    *   **R6 `comments`:** Adds "General assumption is active if missing."
    *   **Implication:** Provides clearer default behavior if the element is absent, which can simplify logic for consuming systems.
*   **`Patient.deceased[x]`:**
    *   **R6 `description`:** More precise: "Indicates the date when the individual died, or, if the date is not known or cannot be estimated, a flag indicating the patient is known to be deceased."
    *   **R6 `short`:** Changed from "Indicates if the individual is deceased or not" to "Indicates if/when the individual is deceased."
    *   **Implication:** Subtle refinement in wording for clarity, no change in data type or core meaning.
*   **`Patient.multipleBirth[x]`:**
    *   **R6 `description`:** Adds context: "Count is relative to live births and fetal losses (see 'patient-multipleBirthTotal' extension). Boolean can track known multiple fetuses before birth."
    *   **R6 `comments`:** Adds "Integer only used after live birth."
    *   **Implication:** Provides more specific guidance on using the boolean vs. integer forms and introduces awareness of a related extension, improving data quality and interpretation.
*   **Resource Description (Overall):**
    *   **R4:** "Demographics and other administrative information about an individual or animal receiving care or other health-related services."
    *   **R6:** "Demographics and other administrative information about an individual or animal that is the subject of potential, past, current, or *future* health-related care, services, or *processes*."
    *   **Implication:** The R6 definition subtly broadens the scope to explicitly include future care/processes, making it more encompassing for use cases like public health planning or prospective research.

## 2. Scope and Usage Evolution

*   **Patient vs. Related Entities:**
    *   R6 provides more explicit guidance in its "Background and Scope" section on the distinct uses of `Patient`, `Person` (for linking resource instances representing the same individual across roles), `Patient.contact` (for contacts not needing independent reference), and `RelatedPerson` (for independently referencable related individuals).
    *   **Implication:** Helps implementers choose the correct resource or mechanism for representing different types of relationships and identity links.
*   **Linking and Merging:**
    *   R6 explicitly states: "`Linkage` Resource: Generally *not* used for linking Patient records; `Patient.link` or `Person` are preferred for patient identity management."
    *   **Implication:** Clearer guidance discourages the use of `Linkage` for patient identity, directing implementers towards more appropriate Patient-specific mechanisms.
*   **Gender and Sex Representation:**
    *   R6 explicitly mentions evolving guidance: "Specific aspects like gender identity, sex for clinical use (SPCU), sex assigned at birth, and clinical observations about sex characteristics are handled via standard extensions (like `genderIdentity`, `sexParameterForClinicalUse`) or the `Observation` resource, often following guidance like the Gender Harmony IG."
    *   **Implication:** Signals a move towards more granular and standardized ways to represent diverse sex and gender information, encouraging implementers to look beyond the basic `Patient.gender` field and consult specialized Implementation Guides like Gender Harmony.
*   **Maturity Level Indication:**
    *   R6 YAML includes `maturity_level: N` and `standard_status: Normative (from v4.0.0)`, explicitly indicating the normative status from R4 onwards. R4's YAML had `standard_status: Normative`. This is more of a metadata refinement.

## 3. Data Modeling Impacts

The primary data modeling impacts stem from the changes within `Patient.contact`:

*   **Separation of Personal vs. Functional Relationships:** The introduction of `Patient.contact.role` alongside the refined `Patient.contact.relationship` necessitates a more nuanced data model for patient contacts. Systems may need to adapt their internal schemas to store these distinct concepts.
*   **Support for Multiple Contact Names/Addresses:** The addition of `Patient.contact.additionalName` and `Patient.contact.additionalAddress` (though Trial Use) means that data models for contacts might need to shift from a single name/address to a list or a one-to-many relationship for these attributes if these new fields are utilized.
*   **Language Coding:** The shift in `Patient.communication.language` to a required binding on `all-languages` reinforces the need for systems to handle a wide range of BCP-47 language codes, rather than being limited to a smaller "common" set.

## 4. Significant Constraint Changes

*   **`pat-1`:** This constraint (`SHALL at least contain a contact's details or a reference to an organization` for `Patient.contact`) remains unchanged between R4 and R6.
*   **Trial Use (TU) Elements:** The new elements `Patient.contact.role`, `Patient.contact.additionalName`, and `Patient.contact.additionalAddress` are flagged as `[TU]`. While not formal invariants, this status acts as an implicit constraint on their stability and production readiness. Implementers should be aware that these elements *could* change in future FHIR versions before becoming normative.

## 5. Search Parameter Differences

A review of the provided `searchParameters` sections for R4 and R6 shows **no significant changes** in the available search parameters, their types, or their core expressions.

*   The `death-date` search parameter is present in both R4 and R6 with the same name and type. The expression `Patient.deceased.as(dateTime)` in R4 and `(Patient.deceased as dateTime)` in R6 are functionally identical.
*   All other listed search parameters appear consistent between the two versions.

**Implication:** Querying capabilities for the Patient resource at a high level remain consistent. Existing search queries should largely continue to function, though the data returned (especially for `Patient.contact` related searches if they were to become more granular) might change due to the underlying data model shifts.

---

This report should provide a solid foundation for implementers to understand the key differences and plan their migration or dual-support strategies for the FHIR Patient resource. Careful attention to the `Patient.contact` changes and the updated `Patient.communication.language` binding is crucial. the new binding priorities, potentially supporting a wider range of BCP-47 codes.
*   **Search Parameter Renaming:** The change from `deathdate` to `death-date` will require updates to search queries and server-side indexing.
*   **Leveraging New Guidance:** The improved "Background and Scope" and element-level comments offer valuable context that can lead to better system design and data quality.

## 4. Mechanical vs. Conceptual Changes

**Mechanical Changes:**

*   **Renaming:** The search parameter `deathdate` (R4) to `death-date` (R6).
*   **Minor Wording Tweaks:** Many descriptions and comments have slightly altered phrasing for clarity without changing the fundamental meaning (e.g., `Patient.identifier` comment, `Patient.link` modifierReason).
*   **Metadata Structure:** The change from `standard_status` to `maturity_level` + `standard_status` in the resource metadata.
*   **Binding Strength/Order (where underlying concept is similar):** While the `Patient.communication.language` binding change has conceptual implications (promoting BCP-47), the reordering of existing value sets could be seen as partly mechanical. The change for `Patient.contact.relationship` (new ValueSet, strength change) is more conceptual due to the scope change.

**Conceptual Changes:**

*   **Expansion of `Patient.contact`:**
    *   **Addition of `Patient.contact.role`:** This introduces a new concept to distinguish functional roles from personal relationships.
    *   **Refinement of `Patient.contact.relationship`:** Narrowing its scope to "personal" relationships.
    *   **Addition of `Patient.contact.additionalName` and `Patient.contact.additionalAddress`:** Conceptually allows contacts to have multiple names/addresses, aligning them more with the Patient's own name/address cardinality.
*   **Broadened Resource Scope:** The modification to the root `Patient` element's description to include "potential, past, current, or future" subjects of care/services slightly broadens the conceptual scope of the resource.
*   **Enhanced Guidance:** The significant additions and clarifications in the "Background and Scope" section (e.g., Patient vs. Person vs. RelatedPerson, Gender and Sex guidance) represent conceptual shifts in how the resource is intended to be understood and used within the wider FHIR ecosystem, even if they don't change the Patient resource structure itself.
*   **Prioritization of BCP-47 for `Patient.communication.language`:** Making `all-languages` the primary required binding is a conceptual push towards more comprehensive and standardized language coding.
*   **Improved Precision in Field Definitions:** Clarifications for `Patient.multipleBirth[x]` (context of integer, use of boolean) and `Patient.deceased[x]` (guidance on boolean vs. dateTime) are conceptual refinements improving data modeling.
