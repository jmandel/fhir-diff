# FHIR IceCream Resource: R4 to R6 Migration Guide

This document details significant changes to the FHIR IceCream resource between versions R4 and R6, focusing on aspects critical for implementers. It aims to be clear, actionable, dense, and precise to aid in migration and system adaptation.

## 1. Executive Summary: Key Impacts for Implementers

Migrating the IceCream resource from R4 to R6 involves several key changes:

1.  **Flavor Representation:** R6 introduces a new `flavorProfile` backbone element, allowing for more granular description of flavor components, replacing the simpler R4 `primaryFlavor` (string) and `secondaryFlavor` (string) elements. This is a **Breaking Change** requiring data model updates and migration.
2.  **Topping Structure:** The `toppings` element, previously a simple list of `string`, is now a list of `Reference(ToppingIngredient)` in R6, enabling richer, structured information about each topping. This is also a **Breaking Change**.
3.  **New `dietaryConsiderations` Element:** R6 adds a `dietaryConsiderations` element (type `CodeableConcept`, `0..*`) to capture information like "nut-free," "dairy-free," etc., enhancing its clinical or allergen-tracking utility.
4.  **`servingTemperature` Binding Change:** The `servingTemperature` element's value set binding has been strengthened from `example` to `preferred`, and the value set itself has been updated for better standardization.
5.  **Scope Expansion:** The overall description of IceCream in R6 now explicitly includes "frozen yogurts and sorbets," broadening its intended use.
6.  **Search Parameter Changes:** A new search parameter `flavor-component` has been added to query the new `flavorProfile.component.type`. The `primary-flavor` search parameter from R4 has been removed.

## 2. Overall Resource Scope and Purpose

*   **R4 Focus:** Primarily described "dairy-based frozen desserts."
*   **R6 Expansion:** The resource description now explicitly states it covers "dairy-based frozen desserts, frozen yogurts, and sorbets," indicating a broader scope and applicability for various frozen treat types.
*   **Impact:** Systems may need to adjust categorization or internal logic if they were strictly limited to dairy ice cream based on the R4 definition.

## 3. Element-Level Changes

### 3.1. New Elements in R6

The following elements have been added in R6:

*   **`IceCream.flavorProfile` (New)**
    *   **Cardinality:** `0..1`
    *   **Type:** BackboneElement, containing:
        *   `component` (`0..*`, BackboneElement) with:
            *   `type`: `CodeableConcept` (e.g., "Vanilla Bean," "Chocolate Swirl," "Mint Extract")
            *   `intensity`: `code` (e.g., "subtle," "moderate," "strong")
            *   `notes`: `string` (optional descriptive notes)
    *   **Short Description/Purpose:** Provides a structured way to describe complex flavor profiles with multiple components and their characteristics. This replaces the simpler `primaryFlavor` and `secondaryFlavor` from R4.
    *   **Key Impact/Action for Implementers:** This is a **Breaking Change**. Data from R4 `primaryFlavor` and `secondaryFlavor` will need to be migrated into this new structure. Systems must implement handling for this backbone element. A new search parameter `flavor-component` targets `flavorProfile.component.type`.

*   **`IceCream.dietaryConsiderations` (New)**
    *   **Cardinality:** `0..*`
    *   **Type:** `CodeableConcept`
    *   **Binding:** `http://example.org/fhir/ValueSet/icecream-dietary-considerations` (example strength)
    *   **Short Description/Purpose:** Allows for specifying dietary properties like "nut-free," "dairy-free," "low-sugar," "vegan."
    *   **Key Impact/Action for Implementers:** New element to support for filtering or displaying dietary information. Systems may need to integrate with relevant terminology.

*   **`IceCream.productionBatchNumber` (New)**
    *   **Cardinality:** `0..1`
    *   **Type:** `Identifier`
    *   **Short Description/Purpose:** Captures the manufacturing batch number for traceability.
    *   **Key Impact/Action for Implementers:** If batch tracking is required, this new standard element can be used.

### 3.2. Modified Elements (R4 to R6)

Key existing elements have been modified as follows:

*   **`IceCream.toppings` (Modified)**
    *   **R4 Type:** `string`, `0..*` (A simple list of topping names)
    *   **R6 Type:** `Reference(ToppingIngredient)`, `0..*`
    *   **Rationale / Key Impact:** This is a **Breaking Change**. Instead of simple strings, toppings are now references to a (hypothetical) `ToppingIngredient` resource, allowing for much richer, structured information about each topping (e.g., its own ingredients, allergens, quantity).
        *   **Action:** Data migration is required. Systems must adapt to store and process references to `ToppingIngredient` resources instead of strings. UI for selecting toppings will likely need significant updates.

*   **`IceCream.servingTemperature` (Modified)**
    *   **R4 Binding:**
        *   `valueSet`: `http://example.org/fhir/ValueSet/r4-serving-temps`
        *   `strength`: `example`
    *   **R6 Binding:**
        *   `valueSet`: `http://example.org/fhir/ValueSet/r6-standard-serving-temps`
        *   `strength`: `preferred`
    *   **Rationale / Key Impact:** The value set has been updated for better standardization, and the binding strength increased to `preferred`, encouraging more consistent use of the standard codes.
        *   **Action:** Review and update mappings to the new value set. Systems should prioritize codes from the `r6-standard-serving-temps` ValueSet.

*   **`IceCream.brandName` (Modified)**
    *   **R4 Type:** `string`
    *   **R6 Type:** `markdown`
    *   **Rationale / Key Impact:** Allows for richer formatting of the brand name if needed (e.g., for display purposes, including trademark symbols).
        *   **Action:** Systems displaying `brandName` should be capable of rendering markdown. Data migration from R4 `string` is straightforward.

### 3.3. Removed Elements from R4

*   **`IceCream.primaryFlavor` (Removed)**
    *   **R4 Type:** `string`
    *   **Rationale / Key Impact:** This element, along with `secondaryFlavor`, has been superseded by the more comprehensive `IceCream.flavorProfile` backbone element in R6.
        *   **Action:** **Breaking Change.** Data must be migrated to the new `flavorProfile` structure. The R4 search parameter `primary-flavor` is also removed.

*   **`IceCream.secondaryFlavor` (Removed)**
    *   **R4 Type:** `string`
    *   **Rationale / Key Impact:** Superseded by `IceCream.flavorProfile`.
        *   **Action:** **Breaking Change.** Data must be migrated.

## 4. Constraint Changes

*   **`ice-1` (New in R6):** "If `flavorProfile` is present, it MUST contain at least one `flavorProfile.component`."
    *   **Impact:** Adds a validation rule ensuring that if the `flavorProfile` structure is used, it's not empty.
*   **R4 Constraint `ice-old-1` (Removed):** "If `secondaryFlavor` is present, `primaryFlavor` MUST also be present."
    *   **Impact:** This constraint is no longer relevant due to the removal of `primaryFlavor` and `secondaryFlavor`.

## 5. Search Parameter Changes

*   **`primary-flavor` (Removed)**
    *   **R4 Parameter:** `primary-flavor` (Type: `string`, Expression: `IceCream.primaryFlavor`)
    *   **Key Change/Impact:** This search parameter is removed as its corresponding element `primaryFlavor` is removed in R6. Queries using this parameter will fail.

*   **`flavor-component` (New in R6)**
    *   **R6 Parameter:** `flavor-component`
        *   Type: `token`
        *   Expression: `IceCream.flavorProfile.component.type`
    *   **Key Change/Impact:** New search parameter to query based on the types of components within the `flavorProfile`.

*   **`brand` (Unchanged)**
    *   The search parameter `brand` (Type: `string`, Expression: `IceCream.brandName`) appears to remain consistent, though the underlying element `brandName` changed from `string` to `markdown`. This change typically doesn't affect string-based search parameter behavior unless the markdown contains complex structures that would interfere with simple string matching.

*   **`has-topping` (Modified Expression)**
    *   **R4 Parameter:** `has-topping` (Type: `string`, Expression: `IceCream.toppings`)
    *   **R6 Parameter:** `has-topping` (Type: `reference`, Expression: `IceCream.toppings`, Target: `ToppingIngredient`)
    *   **Key Change/Impact:** The type of the search parameter changes from `string` to `reference` to reflect the change in `IceCream.toppings` element type. Queries will now involve searching by reference to `ToppingIngredient` resources.

## 6. Key Migration Actions & Considerations

1.  **Flavor Data Migration (Critical):** Migrate data from R4 `primaryFlavor` and `secondaryFlavor` into the new R6 `flavorProfile` structure. This is the most significant data transformation.
2.  **Toppings Data Migration (Critical):** Convert R4 `toppings` (list of strings) to R6 `toppings` (list of `Reference(ToppingIngredient)`). This will likely involve creating `ToppingIngredient` resources if they don't already exist or mapping strings to existing ones.
3.  **Adopt New Elements:** Evaluate and implement support for `dietaryConsiderations` and `productionBatchNumber` as needed.
4.  **Update Serving Temperature Logic:** Adapt to the new `servingTemperature` value set and its `preferred` binding strength.
5.  **Handle Markdown for Brand Name:** Ensure display logic for `brandName` can render markdown.
6.  **Update Validation Logic:** Implement the new `ice-1` constraint and remove logic for the old `ice-old-1` constraint.
7.  **Revise API Queries:**
    *   Remove usage of the `primary-flavor` search parameter.
    *   Implement queries using the new `flavor-component` search parameter.
    *   Update queries using `has-topping` to work with references.
8.  **Address Scope Change:** Consider if the inclusion of "frozen yogurts and sorbets" impacts your system's categorization or processing of IceCream resources.
